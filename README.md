<h1> Quantum Fruit Ninja </h1>

<p>Welcome to Quantum Fruit Ninja, a 3d unity game based on and inspired by the classic game Fruit Ninja.</p>
<p>The group who created this game presents a known and loved game with a unique twist.</p>

<h2> The Quantum Part </h2>
<p>Quantum Fruit Ninja demonstrates two different quantum physics concepts, entanglement and tunnelling.</p>

<h3> Entanglement </h3>
<p>Small photons have a chance to become entangled. </p>
<p>It is known they become entangled if when cut they split into two different photons.</p>
<p>Once two photons become entangled, slicing one slices the other. This is similar to how entanglement works in quantum physics, where two particles who are entangled share intrinsic traits like spin.</p>

<h3> Tunnelling </h3>
<p>Tiny quarks also have a chance to tunnel. </p>
<p>If a quark tunnels, it passes through the blade and teleports somewhere else, something it can't usually do.</p>
